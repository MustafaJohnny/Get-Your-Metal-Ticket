# Get Your Metal Ticket - OOP JS Project

## Overview

Get Your Metal Ticket is really simple and fun project. The user have/has to input a band name, which city interested in and the price of the ticket that he/she wants. The user then can just hit search and waits for 5 seconds to get his metal \m/ ticket. This application was really fun to built, it took me over one week to complete, the goal of this project was to practice and use all the core features of JavaScript OOP as welll as ES6 Classes and prototypal inheritance.
